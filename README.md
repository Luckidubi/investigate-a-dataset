## Project Investigate A Dataset
This dataset is from The Movie database, it contains over 10,000 movies
with their various titles, ratings, budgets, revenue and so on. My
analysis of the dataset answers the following questions:

1. Which genres are most popular from all time?
> Finding the answer to this question will also help to determine the amount of revenue they generate
2. Which movies are the most popular of all time?
> Answering this question will help us to know the characteristics of what makes a movie popular, whether it's influenced by high budget or not.
3. Which movie title has the highest budget?
> The answer to this question can help us find out if high budget movies are equivalent to high revenue movies.
4. Which movie title has the highest revenue?
> Finding the answer to this question can help us check the budget associated with it, and the properties they have.
5. What is the association of runtime over the period of time?
> We can find out if movie runtime increases or decreases over the years by answering this question
6. What is the relationship of revenue over the period of time?
> This will help us know if movie industries are earning more revenue from movie production over the years.
